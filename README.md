# TODO

* Originally the MI4190 and HP8720 classes were built with _Prologix extensions and it made sense at the time. However, since then things have changed and the separate classes no longer make sense. To clean up, the _Prologix classes should be integrated back into the core classes.
* There is still a nasty bug related to the log in MotionControllerApp. Try opening and closing it a few times in a row and you'll see what I mean.
